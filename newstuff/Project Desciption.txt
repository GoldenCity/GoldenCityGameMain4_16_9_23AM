Unity Engine prototype of Golden City 

The plan:
Enemies spawn from several spawners and advance toward the wall player must defend. few at first and in groups as time goes on.
Player controls a cannon, flinging projectiles at the enemies. 
Projectile will "explode" on impact, doing an area effect.
Enemies that get past player's primary defenses pile up at the gate. 
Player's secondary defense is an "electrified" gate. Button press activates electric gate and kills enemies touching gate.
Kills recharge the electric gate before it can be used again.
If a large enough number of enemies are at the gate, the gate breaks and enemies pass, triggering GAME OVER.

+new scene to try out new cannon script
+cannon now trys to launch projectile so it will land where cursor points at ground
+added blob shadow to projectile
+added 'bullseye' to projectile placed where it expects to land
+made a script to change the camera with C key (cam must be tagged MainCamera for cannon script and added to array in CameraController)

11/04/2012
+made a cannon script with a cool down time between firings
+made monster spawner increase spawnlings after time has past
+made Zap button kill enemies touching gate, recharges from kills
+too many enemies at gate will destroy gate
+putting GUI elements into a script atached to camera
+added "game over" screen

10/30/2012
+added "exploding" projectile
+changed enemies to have "health points" -there's somthing about doing operations on arguments i do not understand
-broke the enemy "at gate" counter- didnt really work anyway
-tried making a monster spawner that would incease spawnlings at timed intervals- too sloppy, wouldnt work
+added show/hide cursor (C key)
+added global game options script
+added ZAP button to trigger electric fence- only does particle effect ATM

10/28/2012
+added "charge shot" on mouse button press and "fire" on release
+added code to gate to count enemies touching directly and breaks. want to have enimies touching enemies that are touching the gates alse count
+made particle effect for electric gate

currently impelmented:
+cannon's "pitch" and "yaw" are controlled by mouse position on screen
+cannon launches cannon ball on left mouse button click
+enemies spawn in groups from a spawner object on a timer.
+enemies move in a straight line
+enemies depawn when hit with a projectile moving above a set relative velocity
+projectiles despawn after collisions

planned:
-cannon ball area effect
-cannon charge up time (hold down mouse bttn for stronger impulse)
-change active camera so we can experiement with different views easily
-target to selection on ground plane(this would work better with different camera views)
-buttons for selecting different projectile types
-more advanced monster spawner (spawn formations, a better timer...)
